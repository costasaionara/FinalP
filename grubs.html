<p>This bakery is a great option for vegans. It has a beautiful green (plants) decoration which gives an amazing vibe. I'm not vegan but they have delicious vegan options and also private vegan dinners each month. Chef Mario Buccellati always say that dishes do not need to include meat to be flavorful. It also has an excellent customer service.
